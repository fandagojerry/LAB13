## Ontlology
There are four webpages, describing aspects of Rugby sport. 

## Taxonomy
Heading describes what type of content will be shared on the page, each page will have an image related to the heading. In the main tag there will be text information about the heading within rugby. Then the last page will survey the web user about what they retained about the data and if they want to inquire about more data on the topic of the whole website.

## Choreography
The main page will introduce the sport with the ball image and description which should lead the person to a terminal area to the next page which will be in a F shaped pattern which will give the user to go to the following page until the last which will survey the user and a return form of data if they want more with an email of contact and thank you.
